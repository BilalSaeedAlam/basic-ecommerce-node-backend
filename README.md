## Project Overview

This Node.js application integrates models for handling collections and documents, MongoDB for data storage, Express Validator for input validation, and Bcrypt for password protection. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-node-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-node-app
   ```

3. **Install Node modules:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Configuration

1. **MongoDB Setup:**

   Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. Update the MongoDB connection string in the `config.js` file.

   ```javascript
   // config.js

   module.exports = {
     // Other configurations...
     mongoURI: "your-mongodb-connection-string",
   };
   ```

2. **Express Validator and Bcrypt:**

   The application uses Express Validator for input validation and Bcrypt for password protection. Ensure that these are properly integrated into your routes and controllers.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

2. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Additional Details

### Models Integration

The project utilizes models for handling collections and documents. These models can be found in the `models` directory. Make sure to customize them based on your application requirements.

### MongoDB Integration

MongoDB is used as the database for storing data. The `mongoose` library is employed for interacting with MongoDB. Ensure that your MongoDB instance is properly configured and accessible.

### Express Validator Integration

Express Validator is integrated into the application for input validation. Validators can be found in the `validators` directory. Customize these validators according to your input requirements.

### Bcrypt Integration

Bcrypt is used for password protection. Passwords should be hashed before storing them in the database. The `bcrypt` library is used for this purpose. Make sure to handle user authentication securely using hashed passwords.
